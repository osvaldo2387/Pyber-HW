Data from Pyber in rural areas has a different behavior than the data from Suburban and Urban areas. 
While in rural areas,  the cities with less Pyber drivers tend to have higher fares, in suburban and 
urban areas is the opposite.
This trend indicates that in those areas where there is a higher availability of drivers, fares are lower. 
Drivers are willing to charge less in order to have a ride.

The percentage distribution of fares and rides is very similar between the three types of cities, however, the	
percentage distribution of drivers is a lot higher in urban areas. Cities in urban areas have a high number of drivers available.

Fares in rural areas tend to be higher than in cities of suburban and urban areas. The distance that each driver covers in rural areas
might explain this type of behavior of the data. It would be nice to have the average distance or duration of the trips in each city type
to compare.
